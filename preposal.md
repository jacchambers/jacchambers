# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- skyrim mod (high on list)
- mobile app that does something weird
- sims mod?
- minecraft mod of some kind?
- twitch bot/addon of some kind (something practical for me to use in future?)
- stream bot that bullies rude people (very petty i know)
- stream bot that automatically times out or bans a user given a certain blacklisted word/phrase/character
- interactive stream bot that viewers can ask questions to directly (will answer if keywords/question can be found)
- bot that automatically switches OBS windows/scenes based upon what window is currently open on a certain monitor

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I would prefer to work alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

will we have the ability to seek a lot of help for more in depth projects? My final idea might take a lot but im kind of interested in pursuing it.
